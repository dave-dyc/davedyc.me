### My Projects

- **[bookwith.biz](https://www.bookwith.biz/)** - The easiest way to book appointments online.

    I made this using [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/), [Google Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/), [PHP](http://www.php.net/), and [MUI-CSS](https://www.muicss.com/).

    The most interesting part of this project was using wildcard sub-domain certificates. This was important to achieve https on all business userpages (anything.bookwith.biz).

    I also made a short ad for this website: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2IJEJ2pqs).

- **[Square Guy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kemine.vironn)** - Infinite runner game for Android

    I made this using [Gideros](http://giderosmobile.com/) and [Lua](https://www.lua.org/).

    The hardest part of this was getting the game mechanics to work. The user could drag the walls up or down, and it was up to my game to make sure that it didn't squish the player out-of-bounds.

    Here's a demo video of the game: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd2Mz23laq8)

- **[Chidorisen](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kemine.chidorisen)** - Unique Puzzle game for Android

    Same engine as Square guy.

    The hardest part of this was getting image overlaps to work. Getting an [impossible staircase](https://i.imgur.com/5ieFQRF.jpg) to render was the task. Another thing was trying to determine what was the least amount of moves for a given puzzle.

- [UM Schedule](https://um-schedule.appspot.com/fall) - Scheduler for University of Manitoba Students

    I made this using [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) and [PHP](http://www.php.net/).

    The hardest part was scraping the course data from Aurora (School's website). This data was in raw HTML, so I needed to parse it into JSON.

- [Waifu Manager](https://github.com/dave-dyc/waifu_manager) - Discord bot that allows everyone to have a bot

    I made this using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/).

    Users would setup their bot, and then use it on public servers. Everyone in the server could have their own bot.
